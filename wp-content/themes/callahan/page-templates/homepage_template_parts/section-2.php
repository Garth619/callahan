				<h2>History of the firm</h2>

				<p>Established in 1984, the civil litigation firm of Callahan & Blaine concentrated on commercial and corporate trial work until we started taking personal injury cases about twelve years ago. Since that time, our lawyers have obtained two of the largest personal injury settlements in United States history, and we have won many multimillion-dollar recoveries for personal injury and wrongful death clients. Contact our office in Santa Ana to learn how our litigation methods have made us California's premier litigation firm for personal injury claims.</p>

				<p>Callahan & Blaine has been built to achieve outstanding results in civil litigation, no matter what the issue in dispute might happen to be. A good example of the way our complex litigation experience supports our success in personal injury was a catastrophic accident case that we settled for $50 million, the largest reported personal injury settlement in United States history.</p>
